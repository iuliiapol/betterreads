# About the project #
Goodreads was acquired by Amazon in 2013 and since then it has not gone under any major updates. The user interface and user experience is outdated, slow, and inaccessible. We believe we can create a competing project that provides a better experience for users and data analytics for the users to track their reading stats. 

We are addressing the problem of Goodreads being an outdated, inaccessible, and inefficient industry standard for a reading social media app. We will differ by improving the interface, allowing social share functions, and providing data analytics for the user. We want the user to be able to look up a book, save it under one of their native lists (to be read, currently reading, and read) and rate the book. We also want the user to be able to share their reading process by social share functions established by Figma. 


## The Problem: ##
We address the outdated, inaccessible, inefficient interface of the GoodReads website by improving existing features, as well as adding new ones.

## Target Users/Primary Audience: ##
Users who regularly read books need resources to find a new book or review an already-read book.

## How it differs from different applications: ##
BetterReads will feature a better interface than GoodReads and allow you to give a half-star review to the read book. Our project will also feature an analytical system that will provide users with graphic statistics featuring information about the read books.

## Description of Activities: ##
* Half-star ratings
* Graphic statistics
* Updated review system featuring the ability to add note that the review has contents spoiling the book
